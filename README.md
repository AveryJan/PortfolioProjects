# PortfolioProjects
This repository includes the projects in my portfolio. 

Some projects include code file(s) and/or a PDF file. 
For those projects that have both code file and the PDF file is meant to provide background of the project 
as well as the findings/conclusions/insights learned from the project. 

For the "Web Dashboards" project, the web dashboards are shown in the PDF file of this project.

The Plots generated in The "Stock Analysis" project cannot be viewed on GitHub.
Thus, these plots were downloaded from the original ipynb file and stored in the "Graphs" folder of this project. 

For Part 6 of the "Data Visualization with Python" project, the maps can only be viewed in the Colab version, but not the GitHub version. 
Selected visualizations from all parts of this project are shown in the PDF file. 

For the "RapidMiner" project, the rmp files (RapidMiner files) are included in addition to the PDF file. 

For the "Project Management" project, the mpp file (a Microsoft Project file) is included along with the PDF file. 
Part of the mpp file is shown in the PDF file.

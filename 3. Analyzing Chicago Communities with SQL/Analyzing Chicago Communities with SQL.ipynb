    "This project uses SQL queries to analyzes three datasets about the communities in the city of Chicago. The datasets are in csv format. Thus, first, database tables were created on IBM Db2 on Cloud and then the datasets were loaded to those database tables. Next, the connection to the database was made to begin the SQL queries. The results of SQL queries help answer questions like what types of crimes were recorded at different levels of schools, which communities have more crimes, which community is the most prone to crimes, which communities have lower income per capita than a set level, and which community has the highest percentage of households below poverty line etc. Overall, this analysis offers a glance of the socioeconomic status and the crime situations of the city of Chicago as well as the crimes related issues at its schools.  \n"

    "1. The total number of crimes occurred during the period covered by the dataset is 533 cases. \n",
    "2. Four community areas out of seventy-seven community areas (per the Chicago Census Data dataset) have per capita income less than 11000 dollars. Thus, the city of Chicago as a whole is not an extremely poor area. \n",
    "3. There are two cases of crimes involving minors. Therefore, the majority of the 533 crimes were committed by adults. \n",
    "4. One kidnapping crime involved a child. This means that kidnapping a child is rare in the city of Chicago. \n",
    "5. Six types of crimes that were recorded at schools. However, none is considered as a serious crime type per classifications of crimes. \n",
    "6. The average safety score of all types of schools is about 48-49 on a scale of 0-100. This means that on average, the security measures implemented at schools are not as sufficient as they should be. \n",
    "7. In the five community areas that have highest percentage of households below poverty line, about 42.4%-56.5% of the households is in poverty. Therefore, although generally, Chicago is not regarded as a poor city, there still are quite a few households in certain areas of Chicago that are poverty-stricken. \n",
    "8. The community with the community area of 25 is most crime prone. It has 43 crimes recorded. A later query identified that the name of this community is Austin (see 10.). Hence, for those people who are planning to reside near or in Austin might want to consider this finding and act accordingly. \n",
    "9. Riverside, which is a very poor community, with a 56.5% of households below poverty line (see query result of Finding 7. above) and an income per capita of 8201 (see query result of Finding 2 above), has the highest hardship index. Therefore, Riverside definitely is the poorest community of all.\n",
    "10. Based on the query of finding the Community Area Name with the highest number of crimes, Austin was found to have the highest number of crimes. This identification was completed by first finding the Community Area Number (25) in the Chicago_Crime_Data Table), and then using it to search for the Community Area Name in the Chicago_Census_Data Table, which contains both Community Area Name and Community Area Number. This process differs from the query of obtaining Finding 8, in which the query was performed using solely the Chicago_Crime_Data Table, which contains only the Community Area Number. Therefore, the Community Area Number was available in Finding 8, but not the Community Area Name. \n"
